In this customized version of the popular Flappy Bird game, I have used my C# programming expertise to create a smooth and engaging gameplay experience. The game's mechanics depend heavily on the precise positioning of objects in space, such as the bird and the obstacles it needs to avoid. I have paid close attention to the orientation of these elements to ensure a visually pleasing and coherent spatial arrangement that improves the game's playability.

I have implemented advanced timing and frame management techniques to achieve a seamless and responsive game feel. This approach guarantees that the game runs smoothly and provides fluid motion of the bird and obstacles, which is critical for the high-speed decision-making that the game requires. By carefully adjusting timing and frames, I have created an intuitive and satisfying user experience, making each game session both challenging and rewarding.

Through this project, I have been able to apply my C# programming knowledge in a practical and creative context while also deepening my understanding of game development principles such as object orientation, collision detection, and game loop optimization within the Unity environment. 

I am eager to announce my plans to enhance the game's user experience by developing a comprehensive main menu. This menu will offer users a range of options to choose from, including starting a new game, exiting the current game, and viewing the highest score achieved so far. With this new feature, players will be able to navigate through the game's interface more easily, resulting in a more enjoyable and streamlined experience overall. Additionally, I plan to implement a coin collection system that allows users to save coins and purchase skins for the birdy that I also plan to work on.

Please note that to play the game, you will need to have the Unity engine installed on your computer since the current version is only a prototype and not a finished product.
