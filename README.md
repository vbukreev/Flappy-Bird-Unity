In this customized version of the popular Flappy Bird game, I have used my C# programming expertise to create a smooth and engaging gameplay experience. The game's mechanics depend heavily on the precise positioning of objects in space, such as the bird and the obstacles it needs to avoid. I have paid close attention to the orientation of these elements to ensure a visually pleasing and coherent spatial arrangement that improves the game's playability.

I have implemented advanced timing and frame management techniques to achieve a seamless and responsive game feel. This approach guarantees that the game runs smoothly and provides fluid motion of the bird and obstacles, which is critical for the high-speed decision-making that the game requires. By carefully adjusting timing and frames, I have created an intuitive and satisfying user experience, making each game session both challenging and rewarding.

Through this project, I have been able to apply my C# programming knowledge in a practical and creative context while also deepening my understanding of game development principles such as object orientation, collision detection, and game loop optimization within the Unity environment.
